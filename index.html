                            I have been learning how to program since high school. If I have learned anything from my experiences programming, it is in order to keep up with the ever changing computer world you have to keep programming everyday. I want to take the next step in my career as a programmer and apply my skills in a real world environment. Regardless of where that next step will take me, I am excited to take it and see where I can go from there.

<!--  I have been programming since my junior year of high school.  At first I wasn't very impressed with it. I felt like it took too much work just to make simple program, but as the class moved forward and I started working on harder projects my feelings changed.  It was the first time in my life that something went from being work to being fun.  Even though I found programming fun, it wasn't until recently I realized that I love programming.  I want to get better at programming and everyday I am working on some project of mine but I feel like that will only take me so far.  I want to work in the field, I want to have deadlines, I want to work with other programmers so I can get better. -->
